# Churn_prediction
Customer Churn is also known as customer attrition refers to customer or subscriber stop doing business with company or services. 
A business typically treats a person as churned once a specific amount of time has passed since the customers last interaction with the company or service.

Customer churn is one of the major and most important problem for large companies. Especially in Telecom industry customer will not hesitate to leave if they donâ€™t find what they are looking for. Customer want competitive pricing, high quality service and value for money.
I will create a model which predicts if a customer is likely to churn using open source Telecom data and Python.
this project aims to predict if users will leave the telecom company or no based on historical data0 To do so we should identify which customer to churn 
and assignevery one some score with probability and then target them with high score of churning.
